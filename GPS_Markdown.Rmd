## Familiarization and Cleaning
1. Load appropriate packages and libraries
```{Packages and Libraries, echo=FALSE}
# Install packages
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("feather")
install.packages("zoo")
install.packages("gridExtra")

# Load packages
library(feather)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(zoo)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
```

2. Import CMJ data
```{Import data, echo=FALSE}
# Read the file
gps_data <- read_feather("sample_gps_data.feather")
```

3. Write data into an Excel file for export
```{Write Excel, echo=FALSE}
# Export to an Excel file for viewing/manipulation
install.packages("writexl")
library(writexl)
write_xlsx(gps_data, "gps_data.xlsx")
```

4. Familiarize myself data structure, formatting, ranges, etc in Excel through exploratory sorting/filtering

5. Sort by date as output will be chronological
```{Date Sort, echo=FALSE}
# Sort by date
gps_data <- gps_data %>%
  arrange(Date)
```

5. Remove outliers based on first and last dates of training and extreme total distance values
```{Outlier Removal, echo=FALSE}
# Filter data to data range of first and last data points and filter xtreme total distance
gps_data_clean <- gps_data %>%
  filter(Date > as.Date("2021-02-19") & Date < as.Date("2021-09-17")) %>%
  filter(`Total Distance` == 0 | 
           (between(`Total Distance`, 85, 12000)))
```

## Data Analysis
1. Correlation of Total Distance and High Speed Distance for whole data set, as well as average weekly correlation per player
```{Distance Metrics Correlation, eval=FALSE}
# Overall correlation
overall_cor <- gps_data_clean %>%
  filter(`Total Distance` > 0) %>%
  summarise(
    correlation = cor(`Total Distance`, `Distance > 85%`, 
                      method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs"),
    n_observations = n()
  ) %>%
  mutate(type = "Overall Dataset")

# Average weekly correlation per athlete
player_avg_cors <- gps_data_clean %>%
  mutate(Week = floor_date(Date, "week")) %>%
  group_by(player_id, Week) %>%
  filter(n() >= 3) %>%
  summarise(
    sd_total = sd(`Total Distance`, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_hsd = sd(`Distance > 85%`, na.rm = TRUE),
    correlation = if(sd_total > 0 && sd_hsd > 0) {
      cor(`Total Distance`, `Distance > 85%`, 
          method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")
    } else {
      NA_real_
    },
    n_observations = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(correlation)) %>%
  group_by(player_id) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_correlation = mean(correlation, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_weeks = n(),
    total_observations = sum(n_observations)
  ) %>%
  arrange(player_id)
```

2. Calculate Acute Load, Chronic Load, and ACWR for both High Speed Distance and Total Distance
```{ACWR Calculations, eval=FALSE}
# Begin ACWR
gps_data_clean <- gps_data_clean %>%
  # Group by player so calculations are player-specific
  group_by(player_id) %>%
  arrange(Date) %>%
  mutate(
    # High Speed Distance calculations
    Ac_HSD = round(rollmean(`Distance > 85%`, k = 7, fill = NA, align = "right"), 1),
    Ch_HSD = round(rollmean(`Distance > 85%`, k = 28, fill = NA, align = "right"), 1),
    ACWR_HSD = round(Ac_HSD / Ch_HSD, 2),
    
    # Total Distance calculations
    Ac_tdist = round(rollmean(`Total Distance`, k = 7, fill = NA, align = "right"), 1),
    Ch_tdist = round(rollmean(`Total Distance`, k = 28, fill = NA, align = "right"), 1),
    ACWR_tdist = round(Ac_tdist / Ch_tdist, 2)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

3. Visually double-check ACWR calculations for execution and accuracy
```{ACWR Double Check, eval=FALSE}
# Double check the results for one random player
example_player <- gps_data_clean %>%
  filter(player_id == 69756) %>%
  select(Date, `Distance > 85%`, Ac_HSD, Ch_HSD, ACWR_HSD, 
         `Total Distance`, Ac_tdist, Ch_tdist, ACWR_tdist)
```

4. Find date range of Player 69756's data and filter out all dates before and after (for conciseness of plot)
```{Selected Athlete Date Range, eval=FALSE}
# Get the exact first and last dates with Total Distance data for Player 69756
player_dates <- gps_data_clean %>%
  filter(player_id == 69756) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Total Distance`)) %>%
  summarise(
    start_date = min(Date[`Total Distance` > 0]),
    end_date = max(Date[`Total Distance` > 0])
  )

# Get data within Player 69756's date range
player_data <- gps_data_clean %>%
  filter(player_id == 69756) %>%
  filter(Date >= player_dates$start_date & Date <= player_dates$end_date)
```

5. Calculate weekly averages and sums of distance metrics to be used in plot
```{Weekly Sum and Average, eval=FALSE}
# Calculate weekly averages and exposures for Player 69756
weekly_distances <- player_data %>%
  mutate(Week = floor_date(Date, "week")) %>%
  group_by(Week) %>%
  summarise(
    `Total Distance` = mean(`Total Distance`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `High Speed Distance` = sum(`Distance > 85%`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `High Speed Exposures` = sum(`Distance > 85%` > 50, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

## Plot Creation
1. Plot creation for distance metrics correlation
```{Plot Distance Correlation, eval=FALSE}
# Create correlation plot with r value from overall_cor
correlation_plot <- ggplot(gps_data_clean %>% filter(`Total Distance` > 0), 
                           aes(x = `Total Distance`, y = `Distance > 85%`)) +

    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA)
  )

# Save plot
ggsave("distance_correlation.png", correlation_plot, width = 10, height = 8, units = "in", dpi = 300, bg = "white")
```

2. Plot creation for distance metrics trends
```{Plot Distance Trends, eval=FALSE}
# Create the plot with dual y-axes with formatting
player_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_bar(data = weekly_distances, aes(x = Week, y = `Total Distance`, fill = "Weekly Avg Total Dist"), 
           stat = "identity", alpha = 0.5, width = 6) +

                  color = "ACWR HSD"), linewidth = 1, se = FALSE, span = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(data = player_data,
              aes(x = Date, y = ACWR_tdist * max(weekly_distances$`Total Distance`, na.rm = TRUE) / max(player_data$ACWR_tdist, na.rm = TRUE),

                                         name = "ACWR Ratio", breaks = seq(0, 2, by = 0.2))) +
  scale_x_date(limits = c(player_dates$start_date, player_dates$end_date), expand = c(0, 0),
               breaks = seq(from = player_dates$start_date, to = player_dates$end_date, by = "1 month"),

## Key Considerations

-- **Logic and Thought Process**

- For potential outliers, Total Distance was selected as that value will be > 0 on any training day, as opposed to High Speed Distance
- With Excel's ease of use for data viewing and sorting, I noticed the upper end of Total Distance was around 11000 with multiple entries at +5 million. For the lower end, the lowest Total Distance value that also had any High Speed Distance was ~87
  - Outlier threshold (>12000 and <85) was selected by visual inspection because of the "unbounded" nature of the measurement and the significance of 0 values, instead of using a method like standard deviation
- Although I removed Total Distance 0 values before and after the first and last dates with data, I left 0 values as off-days for the ACWR
- Visual guidelines of ACWR at 1.3 and 0.8 (the "sweet spot") for easier interpretation of risk for under- or over-training. Although the narrative about ACWR has changed over the years, I still believe in the premise
- High Speed Distance needs some context so that's why Total Distance weekly and ACWR numbers were included for comparison

-- **Findings and Practical Applications**

- It's not fair to assume High Speed Distance goes up when Total Distance goes up. With a correlation of 0.28 for the whole data set, and average individual player weekly correlations with at least 10 weeks of data ranges from 0.33 to 0.75, this is a poor relationship
- The Total Distance ACWR remained pretty stable throughout the season, besides the few weeks following what I'm assuming might be an All-Star Break
- The High Speed Distance ACWR had significantly more weekly fluctuations, bouncing back and forth between under- and over-training every ~3 weeks
- I would recommend developing a weekly minimum threshold of High Speed Distance to qualify as sufficient (speed training residual is 5 +/- 3 days) to keep ACWR above 0.8

-- **Limitations and Future Considerations**

- Evaluating entire data set together, no consideration of position nor session type
    - Dive in distance standards/norms per position group per session type
- Evaluate if +85% if achieved during running out a single or double (position players) or what distance of sprint is needed (pitchers) for more practical programming
- Develop an optimal "weekly HSD exposures" (ie days > 50), assuming it'll be ~1-3 days to try to maintain a high-low High Speed Distance training schedule, if possible
