"Helping athletes and coaches take control of their sports story" ‚Äì that's why I do what I do. As an ex-college baseball walk-on who ended up playing in the DII College World Series just 9 months later, I know how powerful a story can be. I may not remember all my stats, but the moments, the highs, and the lessons still bring a smile to my face when I tell the stories. Now, I‚Äôm driven to help others build their own unforgettable stories through performance coaching and sport science.

Balancing the extremes of publishing academic research with the hands-on world of coaching, I've learned to blend both. The objectivity of data and the subjectivity of collaboration make sport science an exciting challenge, and I‚Äôm passionate about applying these insights in real-world settings. My goal is to make sport science practical and my coaching more reliable, so athletes and coaches can achieve the best possible outcomes.

## Data Analytics Projects
### 1080 Load-Velocity Profiling üëü
- **Objective:** take load-velocity profiling data from the 1080 Sprint to generate group averages
- **Practical Applications:** help coaches more quickly and effective select loads for resisted sprint training for large groups and/or when the time to profile isn't available. As well, this will serve as benchmarks to evaluate individuals athletes compared to group averages.

- [Link to Individual Profiles](LVP_condensed_profiles.csv)

### Velocity-Based Training Squat Load-Power Profiling üí™
- **Objective:** take training data from a variety of squats including load, velocity, and power to calculate both the percent of estiamted 1-rep max and velocity for max power
- **Practical Applications:** help coaches give guidance for velocity training zones for Power Development blocks when the time to profile or prior training data isn't available. As well, this will serve as benchmarks to evaluate individuals athletes compared to group averages.

### Force Plate Visualizations üê∞
- **Objective:** visualize 2 different force plate metrics over time to give a quick snapshot of the team's performance by position group
- **Practical Applications:** help coaches retroactively active high and low periods of training, reflect on unavoidable/confounding variables like in-season travel, etc. to proactively prepare for the highs and lows throughout an academic calendar in the future
