"Helping athletes and coaches take control of their sports story" – that's why I do what I do. As an ex-college baseball walk-on who ended up playing in the DII College World Series just 9 months later, I know how powerful a story can be. I may not remember all my stats, but the moments, the highs, and the lessons still bring a smile to my face when I tell the stories. Now, I’m driven to help others build their own unforgettable stories through performance coaching and sport science.

Balancing the extremes of publishing academic research with the hands-on world of coaching, I've learned to blend both. The objectivity of data and the subjectivity of collaboration make sport science an exciting challenge, and I’m passionate about applying these insights in real-world settings. My goal is to make sport science practical and my coaching more reliable, so athletes and coaches can achieve the best possible outcomes.

## Data Analytics Projects

### Force Plate CMJ Visualization
- **Objective:** create a visualization to communicate CMJ data to an athlete
- Attached R Markdown document for full code, visuals, breakdown of process, and breakdown of interpretation/practical applications
- [Link to CMJ Markdown](CMJ_Markdown.html)

### GPS Distance Trends Visualization
- **Objective:** create a visualization to communicate GPS/high speed distance trends with sports performacne professional to guide decision-making in future
- Attached R Markdown document for full code, visuals, breakdown of process, and breakdown of interpretation/practical applications
- [Link to GPS Markdown](GPS_Markdown.html)

### Load Monitoring Web-Based Dashboard
- **Objective:** create a web-based (password protected) dashboard accessible to coaching staff for quick access to training recommendations based on heart rate data
- Deployed through Github with Python code, hosted on Streamlit
- [Screenshot of Dashboard](Load_Monitoring_Dashboard.png)

### 1080 Sprint Load-Velocity Profiling
- **Objective:** take load-velocity profiling data from the 1080 Sprint to individual profiles and generate group averages to influence loading prescriptions for resisted sprints.
- **Practical Applications:** help coaches more quickly and effective select loads for resisted sprint training for both individual athletes to better tailor their loading prescriptions, as well as for large groups when the time to profile each athlete might not be available.

- [Link to Individual Profiles](https://github.com/matttometz/Matt-Tometz-Sport-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/LVP_condensed_profiles.csv)

### Velocity-Based Training Squat Load-Power Profiling
- **Objective:** take squat data from training from a variety of squats including the variables of load, velocity, and power to calculate both the percent of estiamted 1-rep max and velocity for max power.
- **Practical Applications:** help coaches prescribe training guidelines for Power Development blocks, regardless of if velocity-based training technology is (max power velocity) or is not (max power percent of estimated 1-rep max) available.

- [Link to Results](https://github.com/matttometz/Matt-Tometz-Sport-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Squat_Power_Results.csv)
    
### Force Plate Visualizations
- **Objective:** visualize 2 different force plate metrics over time to give a quick snapshot of the team's performance throughout the year based on position group.
- **Practical Applications:** help coaches retroactively evaluate high and low periods of training, reflect on unavoidable/confounding variables like in-season travel, etc. to proactively prepare for the highs and lows throughout future academic calendars.

- [Plot for mRSI](mRSI_Plot.png)

### Sprint Force-Velocity Profiling Decision-Tree
- **Objective:** quantitatively and visually map out thresholds and consequent programming based on sprint force-velocity profiling results
- [Sprint FVP Decision-Tree](sprint-decision-tree.png)

### Sport Science Project Write-Ups/Articles
- **Objective:** give thorough details in a research article-type format following introduction, methods, data, results, and discussion to share findings and insights from real-world performance case studies
- [Load-Velocity Profiling on the 1080 Sprint: Everything You Need to Know](https://simplifaster.com/articles/load-velocity-profiling-1800-sprint/)

# Research
## Validation of Internal and External Load Metrics in NCAA D1 Women's Beach Volleyball
- **Objective:** Be the first study in women's college beach volleyball, and first load monitoring validation study in all of beach volleyball, to validate sRPE Load and Distance Covered to Heart Rate Load (TRIMP)
- **Implications:** Provide beach volleyball athletes with an affordable and scalable way to monitor load (sRPE Load) based on it's high correlations with both objective internal (TRIMP) and external (Distance Covered) loads.
