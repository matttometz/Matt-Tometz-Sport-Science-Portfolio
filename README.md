## Data Analytics Projects
### 1080 Load-Velocity Profiling üëü
- **Objective:** take profiling data from the 1080 Sprint
- **Practical Applications:** help coaches more quickly and effective select loads for resisted sprint training for large groups and/or when the time to profile isn't available. As well, this will serve as becnhmarks to evaluate individuals athletes compared to group averages.
